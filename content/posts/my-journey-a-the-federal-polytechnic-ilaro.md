## My Dear FPI

I'm a student of Computer Science, at The Federal Polytechnic Ilaro. Getting admitted into this prestigious school was a great achievement for me. I was overwhelmed and filled with joy when I saw my name on the admission list. 
I chose to study Computer Science because of my passion for sciences and it has always been a dream for me to become a computer scientist. Being a student of FPI means you are at home, surrounded by family. Everyone at the polytechnic was willing to assist  and support me. Fedponek made me realize my journey has just begun. T
hank you for taking me a step further in achieving my goals. My top tip for  prospective students is, whilst looking for a place that will help build you for the world ahead, put FPI into consideration.

It’s my fourth and final year studying Computer Science at FPI and I am already trying to juggle and prioritise multiple pieces of coursework, compulsory meetings and workshops with my favourite things to do outside of school. The overall experience is very intersting!
