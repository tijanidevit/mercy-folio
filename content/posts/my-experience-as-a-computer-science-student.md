## What is computer science?

Computers are a part of every aspect of modern life. From shopping to playing games and exercising, there is now an app for pretty much everything. All those systems were created by computer science graduates. Whether you want to work for a big corporation managing networks and designing software or become the next billionaire tech entrepreneur, a computer science degree will open up a world of possibilities.

Computer scientists understand the underlying principles of programming and algorithms and use them to design software, systems and networks to meet the needs of clients and the public. It is a fast-moving, highly specialised field and there is a constant, high demand for talented computer science graduates. Job satisfaction in the field is high, as are starting salaries, so if you like solving problems and have a talent for mathematics and logical thinking, a degree in computer science could be the start of a rewarding career.

## Why I chose computer science

Computer science degrees are structured in an incremental way, starting by giving students an overview of the basic principles. In my first year I might take modules in areas like computational theory, pattern recognition, systems and network theory. There was also some teaching about where modern computer science fits into society, the history of the discipline, a module on business or enterprise in the context of computer science. Many courses also involve working with other students in teams to deliver a project, some universities use their partners in industry and business at this stage so I could be designing for a real world client.

As the course progresses, I learnt a mix of specialist and transferable skills to make me an attractive prospect to future employers. Examples of more advanced modules might be data structures, patterns and signals, complexity theory, or software product engineering.

Towards the end of the degree programme my school would ask us to apply what we have learned in the form of a final project. This runs alongside specialised learning in areas of your choice and my school takes the opportunity to pair final year computer science students with industry partners and researchers. There are also opportunities for professional internships and work with industry mentors in the final year.
